Hey there, I'm `babywei`, I like building stuffs that matter to people. That's hard, because it requires you to understand the core principles of how things work, and then question things from the most fundamental levels. And of course, you need to have certain level of persistence to at least stay consistent on a specific course of actions for a specific amount of time.

By the time I'm writing this, I'm a second year second student undertaking Mechanical Engineering course in `UTP`. It's one of the driest course you could expect, as the course is designed to train students in scoring the highest mark possible on paper. To be honest, I have expected universities to be at least more pragmatic in what they teach, with more exposure of their students to real life equipment and getting them to understand the relevance of what they learn with what they are going to apply in.

> That's so far from the truth

Well I'm not trying to sound like a huge complainer here but I'm in deep belief that things can be better. Certainly it's expensive for universities to buy large amount of equipment just for student's learning activities. Certainly it's hard to make huge changes to the traditional education system in a short time. Certainly exams are still the simplest and most straightforward to quantify students mastery of a certain knowledge.

> But things are going to change soon.

It's already happening. `Khan Academy`, `Mindvalley`, `Youtube`, `Udemy`, `Skillshare`, `MIT Open Courseware`, `Brilliant` ..., there's a plethora of creative learning platforms today online to choose from. Although these platforms are still far from ideal to completely replace our education system today, sooner or later it will mature and transform everything.

> It's only a matter of when.

Why am I'm talking about this so extensively in my first post? Because I'm among the frustrated students who think that our education system can be better, must be better, will be better, and that I would like to be part of the change. Imagine a day when you can easily grasp the concept of `entropy`, by looking at 3D projections of atoms vibrating and getting more dispersed through time.

I've joined a couple of universities club and events and didn't find them too fruitful for my personal growth. Among one of the most amazing clubs I joined was `PETROBOTS` or UTP Robotics Society. I learnt tons of hands-on skill there and understand things better than I ever could on textbooks.

After some time I left the club to start on something else. I revisit my coding skills on `python` and `django` to build a website called `utpshare`. It's basically a website students can buy and sell stuffs, on a community basis. Prior to this, students in `UTP` are selling stuffs on `Facebook` or `Whatsapp` groups and it's just downright disorganized, even to the extent it gets a little bit spammy. To sell on platforms like `Facebook` and `Whatsapp` which basically sort posts based on the latest content, you have to practically spam the platform multiple times a day to stay visible to the community. That's why I believe a community based platform like this will greatly serve to deliver more relevant content for both the buyers and the sellers.

I've been practically coding my website for two months now, day and night, to the extent that I abandoned following up with the current academic progress because it's just distracting. This is a duration way longer than I would have expected. Even now it's not done yet. Now that I'm better at approximating the workload, I would expect to finish the website only by the end of this semester.

Tonight is the night before Chinese New Year. It's a good time to reflect on some of the things I do. I'm starting this blog to drop down some of my feelings along the way as well as writing about some mechanical engineering stuffs. The notes that I made, the articles that I read, the videos that I watch, along the way as I grope my way through the remaining two years journey as a mechanical engineering undergraduate. I'm always finding intuitive ways to understand concept because that's how I can better make sense of things.

And as always hopefully somebody would find these notes useful to them as well.

With madness,<br/>
